# MAP TAB

The Map tab provides an overview of your sensors, links, routes, and signs displayed on a Google map. Additionally, it offers essential information such as the number of collecting links, scheduled links, and active alerts for crowd-sourced users, as well as the number of online sensors, links, routes, and active alerts for sensor users.

**Note:** Sensor data is visible to Sensor Users only.

Key features of the Map tab include:

- **Sensor Markers:** Each sensor is represented as a marker on the map. Online sensors are color-coded in green, while offline sensors are marked in red.

- **Signs:** If you have created one or more signs, they will be displayed on the map with blue markers.

- **Link and Route Colors:** Links and routes are differentiated by colors, ranging from dark red (indicating heavy congestion) to green (representing normal traffic conditions). These colors are determined based on the average travel speed of each link or route compared to the Free Flow Speed.

- **Link Status:** A blue color on a link indicates that the link is currently disabled.

- **Detailed Information:** Clicking on a link or route opens a pop-up window that provides specific details, including its name, free flow speed, distance, last recorded speed, travel time, last updated time, data source, sample size (count) of the last interval, and a speed chart displaying data from the last 24 hours.

- **Map View Options:** You can toggle between the Map or Satellite view by selecting the desired option in the map's upper-left corner.

- **Map Settings:** Map Settings allow you to customize the display by showing or hiding sensors, links, routes, and signs.

- **Map Data Animation:** This feature reloads previously captured data from a specific date and time, enabling you to visualize link and route colors for that specific time period.

The Map tab provides a comprehensive view of your traffic data and facilitates better monitoring and analysis of traffic conditions.
