# INODE™, SMATS’ DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM

Smats iNode™ is a powerful processing platform that utilizes advanced filtering and data mining algorithms to deliver accurate and robust traffic information from your collected Bluetooth and Wi-Fi samples. Through our API, data is transmitted to iNode, where it is automatically processed and analyzed efficiently, saving users time and eliminating the potential for human error that could affect data output.

By offering real-time data processing from sensors' scanners or crowdsourced data, iNode empowers our customers to make data-driven decisions, reducing delay times by up to 50% within their existing infrastructure capacities. With iNode, users can easily update scanner preferences, including activity levels, and toggle scanner operations on and off instantly from anywhere.
