TrafficXHub™ comprises two main components: the sensor and the antennas.

## Sensor
The sensor is the central component of the entire system and is responsible for the following tasks:
- Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning
- Data storage
- Sensor status monitoring
- LED control
- Communication via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or Cellular modem. 

The image below illustrates the sensor's mainboard components:

## Power Supply
The sensor can be powered through three different sources:
1. Power-over-Ethernet (PoE)
2. AC
3. 12V Solar Panel/Battery

## Power Switch
The power switch controls the sensor's ON and OFF states when using AC or Solar Panel Battery power sources. PoE does not have a power ON switch. Once the sensor is powered ON, the processing unit initiates the scanners and other processes until the sensor is fully functional and connected to the SMATS server.

## LEDs
The TrafficXHub™ unit features eight LEDs that indicate the status of various sensor aspects, including power supply, internet connection, GPS, and scanners. You can toggle the status LEDs ON/OFF to save power in solar-powered scenarios and during range testing. Refer to Table 1 for the description of each LED and its status definition:

## Ethernet and Antenna Connections
Located on the bottom side of the sensor, you will find an Ethernet port and two N-Type RF connectors, as shown in the image below. The Ethernet connector is used for PC connection to configure the sensor or for LAN/PoE connection. The N-Type connectors are employed for attaching Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennas to the sensor.

## External Antennas
TrafficXHub™ can detect various Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices, including Bluetooth Classic in Discovery, Bluetooth Connected, Bluetooth Low-Energy (LE) Discovery, and activated Wi-Fi devices. To achieve this, two RF-2.4GHz antennas should be affixed to the sensor's bottom, where the N-type connectors are located.
