# Map Tab

The Map tab displays all your sensors, links, routes, and signs on the Google map. It also provides information on the number of collecting links, scheduled links, and active alerts for crowd-sourced users, as well as the number of online sensors, links, routes, and active alerts for sensor users.

**Important:** Sensors are displayed for Sensor Users only.

Each sensor appears as a marker on the map, and it is color-coded green if online or red if offline.

If you have created one or more signs, they will be shown with blue markers on the map.

Links and routes are also color-coded, ranging from dark red (most congested) to green (normal). These colors are based on each link or route's average travel speed compared to the Free Flow Speed.

A blue link indicates that the link is disabled.

Clicking on each link or route opens a pop-up window that displays specific information, including its name, free flow speed, distance, last recorded speed and travel time, last updated time, data source, the sample size (count) of the last interval, and a speed chart of the last 24 hours of data.

You can change the Google map view using the Map or Satellite view options in the upper-left corner of the map.

**Map Settings** can be used to show or hide sensors, links, routes, and signs on the map, and **Map Data Animation** reloads previously captured data for a specific date and time to display link and route colors for that period.
