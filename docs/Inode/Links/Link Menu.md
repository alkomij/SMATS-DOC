# Link Menu

The Link Menu provides a convenient list of configured links along with their essential information. This list includes details such as the link's Status, Name, Distance, Free Flow Speed, Data Source, and Grid.

**Note:** The Status column is visible when the link's data source is Crowdsourced.

Links' status can have five different values, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Disabled:** This status indicates that the link is not active and does not collect data, even if it is scheduled.

- **Scheduled:** This status signifies that the link is scheduled to start collecting data in the future based on a specified schedule.

- **Collecting:** When a link is in this status, it is actively collecting data until the scheduled collection period concludes.

- **Collected:** This status indicates that the link has successfully collected travel time data according to its schedule.

- **Not Collected:** This status suggests that the link could not collect data as scheduled, and an issue may have occurred, such as the depletion of the company's Google credit.

For additional details about a specific link, you can click on it in the table or navigate to the Link Info Tab.

The Link Menu simplifies the management and monitoring of your links, allowing you to stay informed about their current status and performance.
