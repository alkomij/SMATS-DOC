# CONFIGURATION

After successfully connecting the smartmicro radar to the TMC software, you need to set up the lanes, zones, and enable the statistics module on the zones from which you want to gather data.

To enable the statistics module, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Installation > Site Plan > Traffic Statistics**.

2. Select the desired zone(s) in the **Lanes and Zones** section.

3. Choose the update interval.

4. Select all the **Statistics Features Activation** options that you want to enable.

5. Finally, select the object classes that you would like to detect.

The images below provide screenshots of the “Traffic Statistics” page after the setup. For comprehensive instructions, refer to the smartmicro TMC software guide.


In the above Markdown code, replace `image-link-for-traffic-stats-config.png` with the actual file path or URL of the image you want to include in your documentation. Ensure that the image file is placed in the appropriate directory within your documentation project.
