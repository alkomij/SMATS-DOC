TrafficXHub™ can be set up to collect data from the roadside when secured to a pole using pole-mount brackets and clamps. The image below illustrates the set-up of TrafficXHub™ in the field. The recommended mounting height of the sensor is 3 meters above the ground and at least 2 meters away from any other RF transmitter.


## External Antenna Installation (Some Models)

Some models of TrafficXHub+ use two RF antennas for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth detection. These antennas are dust and water-resistant, but to make them waterproof, the connection between the antenna and the enclosure body needs to be sealed with self-fusing tape.

To prevent water intrusion, follow these steps:

1. Firmly hand-tighten the antenna.
2. Remove the backing film from a piece of the provided self-fusing tape.
3. Begin wrapping the tape around the antenna joint, starting below the coupling ring, and stretch it 100% to ensure good compression around the connector, as shown below.


## Mounting Plates and Brackets

Two pole-mounting brackets are used to secure the sensor to a pole. The image below shows how these mounting brackets should be attached to the sensor case.

**Important:** Ensure that the bolts are tightened securely.


With these installation steps completed, your TrafficXHub+ will be properly set up and ready to collect data effectively. For further details and safety precautions, refer to the specific hardware documentation.

Thank you for choosing TrafficXHub+ for your data collection needs.
