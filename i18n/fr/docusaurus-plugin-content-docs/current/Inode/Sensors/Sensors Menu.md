# Sensors Menu

The Sensors menu displays a list of all available sensors assigned to your account. It provides detailed information about the status of each sensor, including its online and live status, name, VPN IP addresses, input voltage level, current consumption, ambient and CPU temperatures, and grid. This information is presented in a table format.

**Important:** Sensors are displayed for Sensor Users only.

You can access more information about each sensor by either clicking on their names or selecting them in the table.
